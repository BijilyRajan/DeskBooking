This project will create Desk booking facility.


Here I am using TDD approach. First will create a failing test and then write the business logic to 
pass the text and finally refactor the code.

Requirement :- Business logic to implement Desk booking. There should be a method that accept request
details and return booking details as result.

Unit Test - Step 1 is to write a unit test method which check the booking method returns valid result.

Step 1 - Create a XUnit test project.
Step 2 - Create a test class for testing Desk booking process.
Step 3 - Create a test method to check Desk booking returns valid result.
Step 4 - Run the test and it fails as Booking code is not implemented. Implement the minimum code 
		to pass the test and re-run the test again.
